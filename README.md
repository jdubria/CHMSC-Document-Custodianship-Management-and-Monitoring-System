# CHMSC-Document-Custodianship-Management-and-Monitoring-System
The Carlos Hilado Memorial State College-Binalbagan Document Custodianship Management and Monitoring System with SMS Notification was created to help the CHMSC offices and organizations in providing the document management system, especially in electronic document management. This system helped to minimize the workloads of the document management officer/staff and also to lessen the time they consume in document management. The system required the document custodians to upload the soft documents or files- the forms, records, etc. and borrowing information to system’s database so that the document management and borrowing management is met. This system could give information to the borrowers. They are being reminded of the deadline of the document they’ve borrowed through the use of SMS Notification.
